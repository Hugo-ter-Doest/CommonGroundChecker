An online automatic compliance checker for [Common Ground](https://commonground.nl) — the Dutch vision and architecture for open, reusable software in municipalities.

## What it checks

Criteria are grouped into four categories. Each criterion has a requirement level (mandatory / recommended / informative) and a configurable weight that influences the overall score.

## Getting started

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install

# 2. Configure the remote API
cp .env.local.example .env
# Edit .env and set URL to the remote API server, e.g. http://localhost:3000
# Edit GITHUB_TOKEN if available

# 3. Install Lizard (required for cyclomatic complexity criterion)
py -m pip install lizard

# 4. Start the development server
npm run dev
```

Ensure the remote Component Checker Register API is running at the configured URL.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and paste a GitHub repository URL.

A **GitHub personal access token** in `.env` is optional but strongly recommended — the unauthenticated GitHub API rate limit is 60 requests/hour, which is quickly exhausted for newer repos.

## Tech stack

- **Next.js 16 + React 18 + TypeScript** for the app and server API route handlers.
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling.
- **Remote Component Checker Register API** for persistence and scoring configuration.
- **Node.js** runtime for the application and check orchestration.
- **Vitest** for tests and **ESLint** for linting.

## Security scanning

To scan for leaked credentials/secrets locally with Gitleaks:

```bash
# Install Gitleaks once (Windows)
winget install Gitleaks.Gitleaks

# Scan repository history using the local config
npm run security:secrets
```

The scan uses `.gitleaks.toml` and runs with `--redact` so findings are masked in output.

## Tech stack

### Framework and runtime

- **Next.js 16 (App Router)** for UI routes and server API routes in one project.
- **React 18 + TypeScript** for typed UI and domain models.
- **Node.js runtime** for check orchestration and API integrations.

### Data and persistence

- **Remote Component Checker Register API** is responsible for persistence and scoring configuration.
- The local app forwards storage and configuration requests through proxied `/api` endpoints.
- Stored by the remote API:
  - repository metadata and discovered locations
  - per-run analysis results and evidence
  - versioned scoring configurations linked to each run

### UI and developer tooling

- **Tailwind CSS** for styling.
- **Lucide React** for UI icons.
- **Vitest** for tests.
- **ESLint + TypeScript** for static quality checks.

### Analysis dependencies used by checkers

- **GitHub REST API** for repository content, metadata, and refs.
- **Lizard** (Python CLI) for cyclomatic complexity checks.
- **Spectral** (via `npx`) for ADR/OpenAPI style validation use cases.
- **js-yaml** for YAML parsing (`publiccode.yml`, OpenAPI YAML, Helm-related YAML).
- **jsPDF** for client-side PDF export of analysis results.

## Application architecture

The application is built as a single Next.js service with clear layers:

1. **Presentation layer (React pages/components)**
	- Main checker UI (`/`)
	- Admin scoring UI (`/admin`)
	- History UI (`/history` and repository detail pages)

2. **API layer (Next.js route handlers under `/api`)**
	- Validates input, orchestrates checks, persists results, and serves history/config data.

3. **Domain/checker layer (`src/lib/checkers`)**
	- Independent criterion checkers (license, OpenAPI, Docker, Helm, docs, tests, complexity, OWASP, etc.).
	- A central orchestrator combines checker results into one weighted score.

4. **Integration layer**
	- GitHub API client (`src/lib/github.ts`)
	- External tool invocations (Lizard/Spectral)

5. **Persistence layer**
	- Handled by the remote Component Checker Register API; this app proxies storage and scoring config requests through local `/api` routes.

## APIs

### Internal API endpoints

These local Next.js endpoints either run the checker or proxy storage and configuration requests to the remote Component Checker Register API.

| Method | Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/api/openapi` | Retrieve the machine-readable OpenAPI specification |
| `POST` | `/api/repositories` | Create or update repository metadata via the remote API |
| `POST` | `/api/repositories/{repoId}/analyses` | Persist a new analysis result for an existing repository via the remote API |
| `POST` | `/api/check` | Run full analysis and persist result through the remote API |
| `POST` | `/api/check/stream` | Stream progress/events during analysis |
| `GET` | `/api/admin/scoring` | Retrieve current scoring configuration from the remote API |
| `POST` | `/api/admin/scoring` | Save new scoring configuration snapshot to the remote API |
| `GET` | `/api/repositories` | List known repositories with latest summary via the remote API |
| `GET` | `/api/repo-history` | Return analysis runs/history for repositories via the remote API |

### ADR Spectral ruleset source (Admin)

On the **Admin** page, the field **"Spectral ruleset source"** controls which ruleset is used for the **NL API Design Rules** check.

- Supported values:
	- URL (for example: `https://static.developer.overheid.nl/adr/ruleset.yaml`)
	- Local file path (for example: `./rulesets/adr.yaml` or `C:/rulesets/adr.yaml`)
- This value is persisted in `ScoringConfig` and applied to new analyses.
- If the field is empty, the app falls back to the default ADR ruleset URL.
- For local file paths, the file must exist on the machine running the app server (not on a remote end-user browser machine).

### External APIs/services

- **GitHub REST API v3** (authenticated with optional `GITHUB_TOKEN`).
- **Remote Component Checker Register API** for persistence and scoring configuration.

### Request flow (high level)

1. User submits repo URL and options in the checker form.
2. `/api/check` (or `/api/check/stream`) parses owner/repo and loads remote repo context from GitHub.
3. Checker orchestrator runs criteria (parallel where possible).
4. Weighted score is computed using the selected/persisted scoring config.
5. Result + evidence is stored through the remote API and returned to UI.
6. History/admin pages query internal APIs to show prior runs and config snapshots.

## Scoring

Each check has a configurable **weight** (0–1) set via the Admin page. Weights are stored by the remote API as versioned snapshots; each analysis run is linked to the exact scoring config used.

For the Lizard complexity criterion, the Admin page also stores a configurable
**average cyclomatic complexity threshold** (AvgCCN). The check passes when a
repository’s measured AvgCCN is at or below this threshold.

Score formula:
```
baseScore = round((Σ statusScore × weight) / (Σ weight) × 100)
score     = min(100, baseScore)
```

Status scores: **Pass** = 1.0 · **Warn / Info** = 0.5 · **Fail** = 0.

| Score | Label |
|-------|-------|
| ≥ 80 | ✅ Compliant |
| 50–79 | ⚠️ Partial |
| < 50 | ❌ Non-compliant |
